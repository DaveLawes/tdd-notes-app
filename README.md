# tdd-notes-app

This is a simple command-line based notes app. The user can create new Notes class and add title and body to each note. The user can also see all notes and all note titles.

## Motivation

The app is simple but was created using TDD. The TDD process guided the development so the .rspec files reveal the limits of the system but also demonstrate its robustness.
